Q1: 

Q2: Basic starter page with the rocket ship!

Q3. "/" has an error that no path is defined. "/polls" returns the hello world message we wrote!

Q4: Migration basically means telling the database to checkout any changes we made to our code models, and "migrate" them within the actual db itself. 

Q5: You see a basic CRUD functionality for the models. In order to see them, you must register them onto the admin view.

Q6: /polls/38/ = You're looking at question 38.
    /polls/38/results = You're looking at the results of question 38.
    /poll/38/vote = You're voting on question 38.

    If you don't put int, then you get page not found error since the path doesn't match.

    Use 'str' instead of 'int'

Q7: Since we may change the paths later on. This allows us to not have to worry about updating everything!
